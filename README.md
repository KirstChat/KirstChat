### Hi, I'm Kirsty üëã
### A Frontend Developer

---

- üë©‚Äçüíª I graduated from Code Institute in August 2021 and have since started my first developer role at PwC
- üñ• I‚Äôm interested in learning React, Naxt.js, Svelte, SvelteKit and Node.js
- üì® How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirsty-c-154781a4/)
- ü•Å **Fun fact #1:** I previously worked as a full-time bassoonist in the military, but I actually played drum kit for 10 years before joining and had to learn the bassoon from scratch
- üé∏ **Fun fact #2:** I'm also a self-taught guitarist and bassist (not amazing at either but both are lots of fun!)
- üéì **Fun fact #3:** I have a BSc in Creative Technologies which covered some of the basics of web development but I was more interested in videography and sound engineering at the time. Fast-forward 6 years and I can't get enough of coding! 
- üì∏ **Other hobbies:** photography, videography and martial arts
