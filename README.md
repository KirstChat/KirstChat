### Hi, I'm Kirsty üëã
### A Web Developer

---

- üë©‚Äçüíª I‚Äôve recently finished my final project with Code Institute and have started a course on Udemy on Advanced CSS and Sass
- üñ• I‚Äôm looking to contribute to open source projects on completion of the course as well as make a career change
- üì® How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirsty-chatterton-154781a4/)
- ü•Å Fun fact #1: I'm currently working as a full-time bassoonist in the military, but I actually played drum kit for 10 years before joining and had to learn the bassoon from scratch
- üé∏ Fun fact #2: I'm also a self-taught guitarist and bassist (not amazing at either but both are lots of fun!)
- üéì Fun fact #3: I have a BSc(hons) in Creative Technologies which covered some of the basics of web development but I was more interested in videography and sound engineering at the time. Fast-forward 5 years and I can't get enough of coding! 
- üì∏ Other hobbies: photography, videography and martial arts!
