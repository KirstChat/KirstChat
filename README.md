### Hi, I'm Kirsty üëã
### A Full Stack Web Development Student with Code Institute 

---

- üë©‚Äçüíª I‚Äôm currently working on my third milestone project as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development course
- üñ• I‚Äôm looking to contribute to open source projects on completion of the course as well as make a career change
- üì® How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirsty-chatterton-154781a4/)
- ü•Å Fun fact #1: I'm currently working as a full-time bassoonist in the military, but I actually played drum kit for 10 years before joining and had to learn the bassoon from scratch
- üé∏ Fun fact #2: I'm also a self-taught guitarist (not amazing at it but it's still lots of fun!)
- üéì Fun fact #3: I have a BSc(hons) in Creative Technologies which covered some of the basics of web development but I was more interested in videography and sound engineering at the time. Fast-forward 5 years and I can't get enough of coding! 
- üì∏ Other hobbies: photography, videography and jiu jitsu!
